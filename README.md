# Expression-Evaluator

This project implements a mathematical expression evaluator that can perform calculations of different complexities taking into account the correct order of evaluation of operations.

The evaluation algorithm will contain 2 stages:
1. Convert the expression to the postfixed form.
2. Evaluate the expression in the postfixed form.
